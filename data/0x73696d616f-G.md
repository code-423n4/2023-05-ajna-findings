### `StandardFunding.sol`

[`tokensRequested`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-ajna/blob/main/ajna-grants/src/grants/base/StandardFunding.sol#LL211C36-L211C36) could fetch only a storage slot instead of 3 due to getting the whole `Proposal` struct.

[`_hasDuplicates(...)`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-ajna/blob/main/ajna-grants/src/grants/base/StandardFunding.sol#L463) could receive proposalIds numerically ordered and check if the next is strictly bigger than the previous instead of double for loop.

[`fundingVote(...)`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-ajna/blob/main/ajna-grants/src/grants/base/StandardFunding.sol#L519) updates state variables once for every `voteParams_`, when it could cache it in memory and only update once. For example, [`currentDistribution_.fundingVotePowerCast += incrementalVotingPowerUsed;`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-ajna/blob/main/ajna-grants/src/grants/base/StandardFunding.sol#L673) is updated for each vote, so if there are 5 votes, it will write to storage 5 times, which could be reduced to only 1 time by caching the variable in memory.

### `Funding.sol` 

[`_insertionSortProposalsByVotes(...)`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-ajna/blob/main/ajna-grants/src/grants/base/StandardFunding.sol#L816) - could be a linked list so the indexes in the array would not need to change. Also, could receive hints to help inserting in the list, making it a O(1) operation.

[`_validateCallDatas(...)`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-ajna/blob/main/ajna-grants/src/grants/base/Funding.sol#LL103C14-L103C32) enforces that the `targets_` all are `ajnaTokenAddress`, the `values_` are 0 and the selector is that of the `transfer(...). It is overcomplicated and it would be cheaper not to set these parameters and just use them when executing. From my understanding it enables integrating with Tally, but consider changing it in the future.

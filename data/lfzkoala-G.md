#Issue: Inefficient use of storage: (Gas Optimization)
Problem: The `memorializePositions()` function reads from and writes to the storage multiple times, which can be expensive in terms of gas costs.

Solution: Optimize storage reads and writes by using local variables in the loop and writing the updated positions to the storage only once at the end:

```solidity
function memorializePositions(MemorializePositionsParams calldata params_) external override mayInteract(poolKey[params_.tokenId], params_.tokenId) {
    ...
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < indexesLength; ) {
        ...
        Position storage position = positions[params_.tokenId][index];
        ...
        // Save position in storage only once at the end of the loop
        if (i == indexesLength - 1) {
            positions[params_.tokenId][index] = position;
        }
        ...
    }
    ...
}
```

#Issue: Gas Optimization
In the `_getBurnEpochsClaimed` function, there is a `while` loop that runs from `lastClaimedEpoch_ + 1` to `burnEpochToStartClaim_`. The number of iterations that this loop will make is equal to `burnEpochToStartClaim_ - lastClaimedEpoch_`.

Here is the potential issue: if the difference between `burnEpochToStartClaim_` and `lastClaimedEpoch_` is very large, the loop could run a large number of times. Each iteration of the loop consumes some gas, so if there are many iterations, the function could consume a lot of gas. If the total gas consumed by the function exceeds the gas limit for a block, then the function cannot be successfully called in a transaction because it would always run out of gas.

This is why it's generally a good idea to avoid unbounded loops in smart contracts, or at least to be very careful with them. In practice, it might be unlikely that the difference between `burnEpochToStartClaim_` and `lastClaimedEpoch_` would be so large as to cause a problem, but without knowing more about the specific use case and how these variables are managed, it's hard to say for sure. 

Here are a few potential solutions:

1. **Limit the Range**: If possible, you could add a limit to how much the `burnEpochToStartClaim_` and `lastClaimedEpoch_` can differ. This could be a constant value in the contract, and you could add a check at the start of the function to ensure that the difference between these two values does not exceed this limit.

2. **Paging Mechanism**: If the potential number of iterations could be large, you might consider implementing a paging mechanism. Instead of processing all epochs at once, process a fixed number of epochs per function call. This would require the caller to call the function multiple times for large ranges, but it would prevent any single function call from running out of gas. 

3. **Gas Checks**: You could add checks within the loop to ensure that there is always a sufficient amount of gas left. If the gas left drops below a certain threshold, you could stop the loop and return the results up to that point.

4. **Optimization**: Analyze your function and see if there are any opportunities for optimization. For example, you might be able to reduce the number of operations in the loop or eliminate the need for the loop entirely.
